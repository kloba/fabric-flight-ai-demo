## Flight Delay Prediction Lab Guide (Microsoft Fabric)

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on using Copilot and other AI tools within Microsoft Fabric to build an end-to-end flight delay prediction solution. Visitors can follow these instructions to learn how to effectively leverage AI capabilities in Microsoft Fabric.

### Repository: `fabric-flight-ai-demo`

---

## Step 1: Create Lakehouse

- Go to your workspace.
- Click **+ New > Lakehouse**.
- Name it following naming convention: `<prefix>-flightdelay-lakehouse` (e.g., `demo-flightdelay-lakehouse`).
- Click **Create**.

---

## Step 2: Upload CSV to Lakehouse

- Download the dataset from Kaggle: [Flight Delay and Cancellation Dataset (2019‚Äì2023)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patrickzel/flight-delay-and-cancellation-dataset-2019-2023)
- Go to your Lakehouse > **Files** > Upload the CSV file.
- Name the file `flights_sample_3m.csv`.

---

## Step 3: Dataflow Gen 2 ‚Äì Clean & Transform

### Create Dataflow:

- Go to workspace > **+ New > Dataflow Gen2**
- Name it: `dfg2-flightdelay-prep`

### Step-by-step using Copilot:

1. **Get data from Lakehouse file**:

```plaintext
Load the CSV file from Lakehouse named `flights_sample_3m.csv`
```

2. **Remove null ARR_DELAY rows**:

This step demonstrates how Copilot can be used to clean data before analysis ‚Äî it is an example of what‚Äôs possible when preparing datasets for ML workflows in Fabric.

```plaintext
Remove all rows where the value in the column `ARR_DELAY` is null.
```

3. **Create column `IS_DELAYED`**:

```plaintext
Create a new column `IS_DELAYED`.
Set its value to 1 if `ARR_DELAY` > 15, otherwise 0.
```

4. **Create column `DEP_HOUR`**:

```plaintext
Create a column `DEP_HOUR` by extracting hour from `CRS_DEP_TIME` (e.g. 1530 ‚Üí 15).
```

5. **Create column `FL_DAYOFWEEK`**:

```plaintext
Extract day of the week from `FL_DATE` and store in `FL_DAYOFWEEK`. Monday = 1.
```

6. **Create column `FL_MONTH`**:

```plaintext
Extract month from `FL_DATE` and store in `FL_MONTH`. Use Date.Month([FL_DATE]).
```

### Save Output:

- Destination: **Warehouse**

The Warehouse is chosen for storing processed data to facilitate efficient data retrieval and seamless integration with Power BI for analytics and reporting purposes.

- Table name: `flightdelay-features`
- Click **Run** and **Save**

---

## Step 4: Data Agent (AI Skills)

### Create Agent:

- Go to workspace > **+ New > Data Agent**
- Name: `agent-flightdelay-qna`
- Add data source: the Lakehouse or Warehouse table `flightdelay-features`
- Add instructions (optional) and save.

### Example Queries to Try:

**Simple Queries:**

- "What percentage of flights were delayed?"
- "Which hour of the day has the highest number of delays?"
- "How often do flights get delayed on each day of the week?"
- "Show me the top 5 airports with the most delays."
- "Which airlines have the highest average arrival delay?"
- "What is the monthly trend of delayed flights?"

**More Complex Queries:**

- "Compare delay rates between weekdays and weekends."
- "Are longer flights more likely to be delayed?"
- "What is the most common reason for delays among delayed flights?"

---

## Step 5: Notebooks ‚Äì AI Modeling

### Create Notebook:

- Go to **+ New > Notebook**
- Name it: `nb-flightdelay-model`

### Prompt 1 ‚Äì Load and Prepare Data

```plaintext
Load the `flightdelay-features` table into a Spark DataFrame.
Prepare the data for binary classification on `IS_DELAYED`.
Apply cleaning and encoding automatically.
```

### Prompt 2 ‚Äì Train Model

```plaintext
Train a binary classification model to predict `IS_DELAYED`.
Split into train/test sets, fit the model, and evaluate its performance.
```

### Prompt 3 ‚Äì Visualize Results

During this step, you will discover which features most influence flight delays. For example, in the test scenario, the hour of departure (`DEP_HOUR`) had the strongest predictive power ‚Äî flights later in the day are generally more prone to delays. In contrast, features like distance or specific origin/destination airports had much less influence.

This helps demonstrate how machine learning can uncover non-obvious patterns in flight data and guide operational improvements or forecasting strategies.

```plaintext
Show feature importance (bar chart), a confusion matrix (heatmap), and delay rate by `DEP_HOUR` (line chart).
```

### Prompt 4 ‚Äì Predict New Flight

```plaintext
Create a DataFrame with a flight:
- DEP_HOUR = 18
- FL_DAYOFWEEK = 5
- FL_MONTH = 12
- AIRLINE_CODE = "UA"
- ORIGIN = "ORD"
- DEST = "LGA"
- DISTANCE = 733

Apply preprocessing, predict `IS_DELAYED`, and print:
- Class (0 or 1)
- Probability
- Message ("likely to be delayed" or not)
- Confidence %
```

## Step 6: Power BI ‚Äì Dashboard

### Create Semantic Model:

- From the Warehouse table `flightdelay-features`, create a semantic model
- Name it: `sm-flightdelay-prediction`

The semantic model provides a structured layer over your data to simplify building Power BI reports. It helps streamline data access, organize fields for analysis, and enable self-service reporting experiences.

- Use Direct Lake for optimal performance

### Auto-Create Report:

- In the Fabric workspace, locate the **Power BI semantic model `sm-flightdelay-prediction`**
- Click on the **More menu (‚Ä¶)** next to the model
- Select **Auto-create report** ‚Äî this automatically generates a suggested Power BI report with visuals based on your data model
- You can edit the layout or keep the default structure
- Click **Save** ‚Äî your report will be saved in the same workspace if you have write access, or in **My Workspace** otherwise

### What you can learn from this lab

- How to clean and enrich flight data using Dataflow Gen2 and Copilot.
- How to build a binary classification model using Copilot in Notebooks.
- How to identify the most important factors influencing flight delays. For example, in this scenario, departure hour (`DEP_HOUR`) had the strongest impact on delays, while other features like distance or route have minimal influence.
- How to ask natural language questions to your dataset using Data Agent.
- How to auto-generate a Power BI report in one click using a semantic model.

All these steps can be conducted without writing a single line of code ‚Äî this lab shows how you can use Copilot to streamline your analytical work and boost productivity.

This lab showcases how Microsoft Fabric Copilot helps reduce friction across the full data-to-insight workflow.
